# Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project is part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, fare, etc.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Titanic Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv)
- Features: Age, Sex, Pclass, Fare, Siblings, Parents, etc.
- Target: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier

## ✅ Steps:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
3. Splitting data into train and test sets
4. Training a Random Forest model
5. Evaluating with accuracy and classification report

## 📈 Accuracy Achieved
