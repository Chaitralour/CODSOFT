# Task 5 - Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳

This project is part of the **CodSoft Data Science Internship**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Build a machine learning model to detect **fraudulent credit card transactions** using transaction features like amount, anonymized variables (V1 to V28), and time.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Features: 30 input features (`V1` to `V28`, `Amount`, `Time`)
- Target: `Class` (0 = Not Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier
- Classification Report & Accuracy Score

## ✅ Steps:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Class distribution check (high imbalance)
3. Data split (train-test with stratification)
4. Random Forest training
5. Evaluation with precision, recall, F1-score

## 📈 Accuracy Achieved
> 100%
